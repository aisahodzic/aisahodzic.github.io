Project Name: New Friends Film Premiere Website

Project Description: 

The project New Friends Film Premiere Website is a website that features the short movie “New Friends”. The main theme of the movie is the lack of socialization that people, especially students, encounter in quarantine. The movie and its theme stand as the main concept of the website. Besides offering the user to watch the movie itself, the website contributes to the concept of voicing out the students' concerns, especially those faced in quarantine. While the page is aimed to be open to the public, the desired audience is the NYUAD student body. The experience that I was striving to create is an environment with which the user can empathize, relate, and feel comfortable to later share their feelings about being quarantined in conversations. 

Process: 
The website was made with the main focus on the movie, which can be watched in workshops, courses, or in private. This required simplicity and straight-forwardness, without complex or overwhelming information, to leave the space for the user to feel and discuss the movie in their own fashion. The main page takes the user straight to the movie, after a couple of introductory sentences which impose the theme of friendships and socialization in isolation. The navigation takes the user to the “About” page in which they can learn more about the movie and film festival. The “Cast” page offers an insight into the cast crew while representing cast members as students with hobbies and interests to which other students can relate. The design of the page was very important to implement the chosen concepts. It has subtle hints towards the NYUAD community such as the chosen color palette with violet as the dominant color besides the achromatic colors. Also, the background image was chosen as it shows the sand dunes in the desert, specific to the university location. The interactive components keep the user engaged and contribute visually to the page design. 

Reflection/Evaluation: 
The final working version represents a successful realization of the initial concept. The design ideas and solutions used to communicate the main message to the user have been changing throughout the process of building the page. The website content highlights the narrative of quarantine and friendships while incorporating interactivity and creativity, which was one of the main goals. The page provides a well-designed movie premiere site, informs the user about the movie, the festival and the cast. Hence, the initial concept and goals have been achieved. Further developments such as an additional feature of leaving the comments after watching the movie or forming a dialogue room can be realized in the future.
