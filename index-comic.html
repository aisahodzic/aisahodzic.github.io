			<h2> Who will take you home? </h2>
			<p> The Pilot’s Journey</p>

				<p id="Textdescr">During the pandemic where many restrictions are taking place, we might focus more on how the pandemic is affecting us rather than think about others. Some people have taken a very responsible and brave roles to help others during this pandemic, which we forget to appreciate. Pilots have been conducting repatriation flights to bring people back to their home countries at the spike of pandemics. While there are travel restrictions about which people complain because they can’t travel and have fun, the pilots are the rare ones who must continue fling and thus see the serious situation on different continents. Since people can’t travel right now, we strived to create a feeling of flying together with the pilot to satisfy their wishes to travel, only to arrive in a country location and realize that lives have changed drastically across the globe, from touristic hubs to empty squares. This one is a tribute to all pilots who took us home, safely. </p>
